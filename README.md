### About me

Hi, everyone, my name is Jihao (Richard) Zhang, who is currently a graduate student in Khoury College of Computer Science at Northeastern University and used to be an intern from Amazon and Cepheid.

I used to be an undergraduate student from China major in German Literature. I love computer science and love combining the knowledge from computer science and literature, which could always give me some inspirations. I am familiar with Object-Oriented Programing Languages such as Java, Python, C++ and JavaScript. I also command many basic data structures and algorithms for a more effective coding. 

I am interested in Web developing and Game Design. I could develop front-end pages with React.js and Vue.js and design the back-end developments with Express and Flask. I am also good at using Unreal Engine4 to build some simple 2D games. I am an active boy and loving communicating with others. I hope that I could become a great software engineer in one day and help build a brighter future.
