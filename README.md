### About me

Hi, everyone, my name is Jihao (Richard) Zhang, who is currently a software engineer at Huawei and used to be an intern from Amazon and Cepheid.

I used to be a graduate student in Khoury College of Computer Science at Northeastern University and an undergraduate student from China major in German Literature. I love computer science and love combining the knowledge from computer science and literature, which could always give me some inspirations.
